            <h1>PROFESSIONAL CAREER HISTORY</h1>

            <p align="justify">
                With over a decade of experience in Oracle ERP, I have developed deep expertise in various modules, particularly in HRMS. My proficiency spans the complete configuration and implementation of HRMS, including defining business group structures, setting up elements, writing fast formulas, configuring payroll processing, and handling approvals and workflows. I have successfully led multiple HRMS implementations, ensuring seamless integration with other ERP modules such as Payroll, Finance, and Procurement.

                In addition to HRMS, I have extensive technical experience in Inventory, Procurement, Financial, and Payroll modules. I have been instrumental in developing reports, optimizing queries, and customizing Oracle ERP solutions to meet business requirements. My ability to analyze, troubleshoot, and fine-tune ERP processes has consistently improved system efficiency and user satisfaction.
                
                Beyond Oracle ERP, I have a strong programming background with 5 years of experience in COBOL and AIX, where I developed and maintained enterprise applications. Additionally, I have 3 years of experience in Visual Basic and Crystal Reports, allowing me to design and develop dynamic reporting solutions for business intelligence needs. My ability to bridge technical and functional domains enables me to provide end-to-end ERP solutions, from configuration to advanced technical customization.            </p>
