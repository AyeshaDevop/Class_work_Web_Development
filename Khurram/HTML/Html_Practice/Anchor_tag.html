        <p> <h3><b> Generative AI: <br></b></h3>Generative AI is built on large-scale models, such as GPT and DALLÂ·E, which use deep learning techniques to generate high-quality outputs. It excels in applications like text generation, image synthesis, chatbots, and data augmentation. These models are trained on vast datasets and use probabilistic methods to generate contextually relevant content. However, Generative AI lacks reasoning capabilities and cannot take actions beyond producing responses based on input prompts. It is widely used in content creation, entertainment, and automation of repetitive tasks.</p>
        <p> <h3><b>Agentic AI: <br></b></h3>Agentic AI, on the other hand, is designed to function autonomously by making decisions, setting goals, and adapting to changing environments. It utilizes AI agents, which combine machine learning models with reasoning frameworks, memory, and tool integration to complete complex workflows. Agentic AI is often used in applications such as robotics, autonomous systems, intelligent assistants, and business automation, where AI must proactively solve problems and execute actions. Unlike Generative AI, Agentic AI aims to create self-sufficient systems capable of independent operation without constant human oversight.</p>
        <p id="Difference-genai-agentic-ai"> <h3><b>Difference Between Generative AI and Agentic AI: <br></b></h3>Agentic AI and Generative AI are two distinct but complementary branches of artificial intelligence. Generative AI primarily focuses on creating content, such as text, images, videos, and music, based on the data it has been trained on. It generates outputs by predicting patterns and structures, making it useful for creative and analytical tasks. In contrast, Agentic AI goes beyond content generation by incorporating decision-making, reasoning, and autonomy. It can plan, take actions, and interact dynamically with its environment to achieve specific goals, often using tools, APIs, and real-world interactions. While Generative AI assists in creating content, Agentic AI is designed to take initiative, execute tasks, and operate independently with minimal human intervention.</p>
