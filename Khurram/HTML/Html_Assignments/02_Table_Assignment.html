            <h3>Generative AI</h3>
            <p id="gen-ai">
              Generative AI is built on large-scale models, such as GPT and
              DALL·E, which use deep learning techniques to generate
              high-quality outputs. It excels in applications like text
              generation, image synthesis, chatbots, and data augmentation.
              These models are trained on vast datasets and use probabilistic
              methods to generate contextually relevant content. However,
              Generative AI lacks reasoning capabilities and cannot take actions
              beyond producing responses based on input prompts. It is widely
              used in content creation, entertainment, and automation of
              repetitive tasks.
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>Agentic AI</h3>
            <p id="agentic-ai">
              Agentic AI, on the other hand, is designed to function
              autonomously by making decisions, setting goals, and adapting to
              changing environments. It utilizes AI agents, which combine
              machine learning models with reasoning frameworks, memory, and
              tool integration to complete complex workflows. Agentic AI is
              often used in applications such as robotics, autonomous systems,
              intelligent assistants, and business automation, where AI must
              proactively solve problems and execute actions. Unlike Generative
              AI, Agentic AI aims to create self-sufficient systems capable of
              independent operation without constant human oversight.
            </p>
            <h3>Difference Between GenAI and AgenticAI</h3>
            <p id="diff-b/w-genAI-agenticAI">
              Agentic AI and Generative AI are two distinct but complementary
              branches of artificial intelligence. Generative AI primarily
              focuses on creating content, such as text, images, videos, and
              music, based on the data it has been trained on. It generates
              outputs by predicting patterns and structures, making it useful
              for creative and analytical tasks. In contrast, Agentic AI goes
              beyond content generation by incorporating decision-making,
              reasoning, and autonomy. It can plan, take actions, and interact
              dynamically with its environment to achieve specific goals, often
              using tools, APIs, and real-world interactions. While Generative
              AI assists in creating content, Agentic AI is designed to take
              initiative, execute tasks, and operate independently with minimal
              human intervention.

            <br />
            <h3>AI Ethics</h3>
            <p id="ai-ethics">
              As AI technology advances, ethical concerns arise regarding bias,
              privacy, and security. AI Ethics focuses on ensuring AI systems
              are fair, transparent, and accountable. Challenges include
              addressing biased algorithms, ensuring user data protection, and
              preventing AI misuse in harmful applications. Ethical AI
              development involves creating guidelines and regulations to
              balance innovation with societal responsibility.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <h3>Future of AI</h3>
            <p id="future-ai">
              The future of AI holds immense possibilities, from enhanced
              human-AI collaboration to fully autonomous AI-driven systems.
              Advances in quantum computing, neural networks, and multimodal AI
              models will push AI capabilities further. However, responsible
              development, regulation, and continuous improvement in AI safety
              will determine how AI integrates into society, shaping industries
              like healthcare, finance, and automation.
