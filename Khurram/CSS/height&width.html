      Height The sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow across
      the sky as a gentle breeze rustled through the trees. Birds chirped their
      final songs of the day, settling into their nests as the world prepared
      for nightfall. In the distance, the faint hum of crickets began to fill
      the air, blending with the soft rustling of leaves. A sense of calm washed
      over the landscape, as if nature itself was taking a deep breath before
      the stars emerged to illuminate the darkened sky.
